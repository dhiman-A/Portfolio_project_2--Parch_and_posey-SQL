In this project I have utilised the data from Parch and Posey, a fictitious company that sells paper. They have 50 sales representatives spread across the United States in four regions. They sell three types of paper: regular, poster, and glossy. Their clients are primarily Fortune 100 companies whom they attract by advertising on Google, Facebook, and Twitter.

Using SQL I have tried to help Parch and Posey answer tricky questions like which of their products is worst performing, and which of their marketing channels they should make a greater investment in.

The entity relation diagram for Parch and Posey: shows how data is structured in a database.

The database consists of five tables:

* Web_events 9073 rows and 4 columns

* Sales_reps 50 rows and 3 columns

* Region 4 rows and 3 columns

* Orders 6912 rows and 11 columns

* Accounts 350 rows and 7 columns

My learnings include the following commands in SQL

** Basic SQL â€“ SELECT, FROM, LIMIT, ORDER BY, WHERE, LIKE, IN, NOT, AND, OR, BETWEEN
** Primary key, Foreign key, ALIAS, JOINS - LEFT, RIGHT, UNION, UNION ALL, CROSS, SELF
